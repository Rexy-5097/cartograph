## Current position

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Active milestone | **M01 — TypeScript extraction** (PR #2 open against `main`) |
| Status | M00 **ACCEPTED** and merged; M01 complete and gate-clean, pending human review |
| Branch | `feature/m01-typescript-extraction` |
| Next permitted milestone | M02 — **locked** until M01 is accepted |
| Last accepted checkpoint | `cartograph-m00` (immutable, merge commit `ab196a1`) |
| M01 provisional checkpoint | `cartograph-m01-rc3` |
| Spec | Frozen V3, August 2026 |

## What exists

- Rust workspace, six crates. Domain model (evidence/provenance/confidence
  enforced by construction), architecture graph over petgraph, testkit with
  the spec's worked cross-stack chain as fixtures.
- **M01: TypeScript/TSX extractor** (tree-sitter, contained behind a
  language-neutral fact model): imports, symbols (+enclosing/+export), call
  sites, string/template/concatenation structure, HTTP observations,
  error-tolerant diagnostics. CLI `parse` command. Smoke-tested on zustand
  (35 files) and swr (194 files).
- 82 tests passing; fmt/clippy(-D warnings)/check clean; ts_extraction
  criterion group (numbers internal).
- AgentOS v1.0.0 vendored under `agentos/`, validator PASS 99/100.
- Governance: PROJECT_RULES (25 rules), ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, CHECKPOINTS,
  SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, AGENTS, AGENTOS docs; CI; PR/issue templates;
  CODEOWNERS; quality gates QG-001…008; milestone definitions M00…M17;
  9 Cartograph ADRs.

## What does NOT exist (deliberately)

No Python extraction (M02), no route normalization (M03), no resolution and no
LSP (M04+), no template *evaluation* (M05 — structure is preserved, not
evaluated), no ORM (M06), no storage, no incremental engine, no desktop, no
MCP, no AI. `cartograph-resolver` remains a doc-only crate.

## Open risks

- exFAT working volume: no hard links (cargo falls back to copying), AppleDouble
  `._*` sidecar files; mitigated via .gitignore + `make clean-sidecars`; see
  docs/development/external-storage.md.
- Confidence priors are uncalibrated until M08.
- Node identity is graph-local until M10.

## Session log

| Date | Session outcome |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-19 | M00 checkpoint semantics repaired (ADR-0010: provisional rc tags vs accepted tags; premature cartograph-m00 retired, rc1 created at exact PR head). M01 executed: tree-sitter TS/TSX extractor, fact model, diagnostics, CLI `parse`, 22-category fixture corpus, 82 tests, criterion group, two real-repo smoke tests. PR opened; stopped per RULE 025. |
| 2026-08-18 | M00 executed end-to-end: workspace, domain model, graph, CLI, testkit, AgentOS vendored + adapted, governance docs, gates, CI, PR opened. Stopped per RULE 025. |
